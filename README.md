# Miduino GUI

Miduino is as it sounds: a MIDI music to Arduino code converter. Using this GUI you can drop in any MIDI file, tweak some settings, and out comes Arduino-ready code for an ESP8266 to play the music you picked! Using hardware timers, Miduino.h will play polyphonic notes and percussion for a retro sound!
